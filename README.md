# ⚡ SkillServe – Skilled Worker Booking Platform

## ❗ Problem & ✅ Solution

### Problem
In many semi-urban and rural areas, customers struggle to find skilled workers for small tasks. At the same time, many workers lack digital visibility to reach potential clients. There’s no simple platform where both can connect without delays or intermediaries.

### Solution
**SkillServe** offers a **lightweight web solution** built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Customers can browse available workers and send booking requests. Workers can register, update availability, and manage bookings — all on the frontend using `localStorage`. No backend or middlemen are needed.
